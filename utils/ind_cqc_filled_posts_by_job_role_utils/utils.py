    Adds a column with a count of elements within list of registered manager names.

    This function uses the size method to count elements in list of strings. This method
    returns the count, including null elements within a list, when list partially populated.
    It returns 0 when list is empty. It returns -1 when row is null.
    Therefore, after the counting, this function recodes values of -1 to 0.

    Args:
        df (DataFrame): A dataframe containing list of registered manager names.
